# Raw notes from Chapter 1

The key idea: **1% better every day** compounds to 37x improvement over a year.

- Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement
- Identity-based habits > outcome-based habits
- Focus on who you wish to become, not what you want to achieve
- Small wins build momentum

Systems beat goals. A goal is a direction; a system is the vehicle.
